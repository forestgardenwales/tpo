# An introduction to <br>Forest Gardening 🌳
### _Working with nature_

![Old Sleningford Farm’s forest garden, used with permission, thank you 🙂](img/osf.jpg)

???

* Working with nature. Pretty much sums it up.
* [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/): buy this book
* Read it cover to cover in a terraced house with a paved yard for 3 years.

# Pt. I: What is a forest garden?

> A productive and practical garden system using trees, shrubs and perennial plants, designed to be stable, sustainable and low-maintenance.

## Features

* Diverse harvests 🌰 🍏 🍐 🥝 🍇 🍒
* Multi-layered space
* Large number of species
* Nitrogen fixers & mineral accumulators
* Attract predators & pollinators 🐞 🐝 🦋

???

* Productive. Practical. Low-maintenance. No nonsense.
* Harvest is varied.
* Garden _system_ is the whole system.
* Traditional agricultural science can’t cope with complexity of forest garden, 100+ species of plants.
* History. Robert Hart, Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Other countries.
* My example of resilience and diversity, with north face hedge

# Forest garden harvest

Where you start is what you want.

<div style="float:left">
* Fruits, nuts & seeds
* Vegetables & salad
* Herbs & spices
* Firewood
* Mushrooms
* Poles, canes & twine
* A beautiful space
</div>

# Climax vegetation

![Climax vegetation](img/climax-vegetation.svg)

* Energy
* Fragility
* Uniformity
* Maintenance
* Greenhouse gas emissions

???

* The further right you go, the more you need.
* Frederic Clements coined the term in 1916.

# Scientifically efficient 👩‍🔬

Efficiency is the ratio of the _input_ to the output.

```html
    Animal         1 :  0.8

    Arable         1 :  4

    Forest Garden¹  1 : 40
```

* Proviso: once established
* Perennial plants are less work
* No compost bins, compost in situ

Forest gardening also flexible, any size or part of garden.

# 1. Plan 🗺️

* What harvest do you want?  🌰 🍏 🍐 🥝 🍇 🍒
* What plants do you want? 🌳 🌲 🍀 🍁 🍃 🌿
* [Rootstocks](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) & diameters 
* Windbreaks 🌬️
* Nutrient budget
* Access, paths, structures, utilities 🔌 ☎️ 🚰 🏗️
* [QCAD software](http://www.qcad.org/en/) with [OS map](https://www.themapcentre.com/)
* Scale paper drawing 🖊️

???

* Don’t forget to plan your nutrients – pp57 Creating a Forest Garden
* Get a soil sample from CCF
* OS map from [The Map Centre](https://www.themapcentre.com/), about £40
* Can use [Google](https://goo.gl/maps/934sTaTfWw22)/[Bing](https://binged.it/2sMlUhY) maps
* Remember, the map is not the territory
* Paper cut-out circles for tree positionings

---

# Here’s one I made earlier

![CAD plan of forest garden](img/plan.png)

Calculate areas (ground cover), position trees (diameters)

???

* Drawing made in [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org/en/)
